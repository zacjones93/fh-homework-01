## Goals

- The purpose of this homework assignment is to use unit tests to debug a Rails
  application.

## Readings and Resources

## Project Setup

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
  $ unzip homework-01.zip
  $ cd /path/to/rails/homework-01
  $ bundle install
  $ rails db:create
  $ rails db:migrate
  ```

  Note:  Do not type `$` in the above.  Just the command that follows.

- Test your basic understanding of debugging a Rails application through the
  following:

  - verify that the following works as expected

    - creating author

    - editing author

    - deleting author

    - listing author

    Note:  You can execute the units tests to verify that things are working
           correctly by running the unit tests as follows in the root directory
           of the project:

           ```
           $ rspec
           ```

           Note:  Do not type `$` in the above.  Just the command that follows.

           You are done when the above command generates the similar output:

           ```
           .............................

           Finished in 0.50812 seconds (files took 1.37 seconds to load)
           29 examples, 0 failures
           ```

    - running a specific test
